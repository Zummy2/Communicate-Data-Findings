# Introduction
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

- Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

- Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

The main aims of this project include;
- Supplementing statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
- Choosing appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand  distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.

## Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

- In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

- In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings will be through transforming yomyur exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
 
 Finally, I will be generating a slideshow of the visualizations with jupyter notebook and the pdf file will be uploaded here.

 
## Dataset
For this project, I will be using data from the FordGoBike system data(now baywheels). The dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
I downloaded the datasets from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html) I used data from January 2018 till May 2019, the data has over 2.7 million rows. The dataset had 16 columns before cleaning, after my cleaning efforts, it now has 24 columns, attributes added for analysis and more insights include age, distance travlled in km etc.
